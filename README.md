# Introduction

This project is conducted for detecting mask in Machine Learning class in Fall 2024. 

# Development Period
Oct. 2024 ~ Nov. 2024

# Key Features

1. Train Convolutional model.
   -> multiple datasets (dataset1 ~ dataset4) were tried to test the model. the datasets are available in https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GFb56QS66ZvubeESt4oX1rvF26-F-1NB/view?usp=drive_link
   -> Download this dataset and place under the root directory.
   -> The final version of mask detection model was trained by using dataset4 in dataset directory.
2. Yolo.
   -> Yolo was trained by using dataset1 and face dataset.
   -> face dataset includes about 600 manually labeled images

3. video processing
   -> OpenCV was used to process test video

  All configuration information is defined in 'src/config/config.yaml'
